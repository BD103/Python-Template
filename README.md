# Python Template

This is a template that I plan on using for all of my future Python projects. The rest of this README will be filled out with sections that should be covered in any project.

## Installation

```shell
python -m pip install -U pypackage
```

## Getting Started

Short description on how you use the package.

```python
import pypackage

pypackage.do_thing()
```

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a PR if you want to contribute to the package. For more information, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
